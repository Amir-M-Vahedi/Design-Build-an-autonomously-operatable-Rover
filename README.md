# Design-Build an autonomously operatable Rover
This project is about designing and buliding a Rover Robot. 
In this project, the control algorithms are implemented on an arduino UNO board. 
A control software was designed in order to send command to the rover via Bluetooth. The software was written down in Python.
The arduino code for each sensor and module was developed separately and in the end they unified.
The mechanical parts were designed in SOLIDWORKS and then built. The assembly of the Rover is shown in figure below.
